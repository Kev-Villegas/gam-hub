# React + TypeScript Project Based on Rawg.io

In this project, I used React.js and TypeScript and learned how to make data requests using Axios. I also gained skills in handling errors effectively when facing common problems in API requests. This experience allowed me to improve my understanding of interacting with servers and ensure a more robust and seamless user experience in my application.
